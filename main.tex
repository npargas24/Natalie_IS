%
% \documentclass{woosterthesis} must be at the beginning of every IS. Options are the same as
% for the report class with some additional options: abstractonly, acs, alltt, apa, blacklinks, chicago,
% code, colophon, dropcaps, euler, foreignlanguage, gauss, index, kaukecopyright, lshortwooster, maple, mla, palatino, picins,tikz,
% verbatim, wblack, and woostercopyright. The kaukecopyright option will put the arch symbol with the word mark on the
% copyright page. The woosterthesis class is based on the report class. One thing to note is that
% the ``%'' symbol comments out all characters that follow it on the line.
%

%
% Checked on 8/26/22 and compiles with no fatal errors. Users must have the latest version of the TeXLive software and
% have installed all available packages from CTAN to ensure this thesis class compiles with no fatal errors. Also, you must
% run pdfLaTex, Biber, MakeIndex, padfLaTeX, pdfLaTeX to get all the numbering and references resolved. This is the
% first year the template uses Biber for references.

\begin{abstract}
The abundance and ubiquity of small, bespoke, Internet of Things (IoT) devices has widened a growing knowledge gap between what is understood about them and their actual capabilities. Thousands of new devices are released each year, where each variety can see millions of units produced and sold. Closing or narrowing this gap requires a coordinated analysis effort, necessitating bolstered numbers of individuals with the knowledge to address this issue. However, without access to source code, build system, and detailed software/hardware documentation, this cannot be done in the traditional analysis or forward engineering paradigm. In contrast, reverse engineering is the iterative process and methodology by which hardware and software can be understood with little or no access to the information and resources the developers used to make a given device. This paper serves as a guide on how to approach and successfully reverse engineer a device to the point of being able to augment its' functionality.

\begin{acknowl}  
First, I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Professor Drew Guarnera. His guidance and encouragement during our advising sessions were instrumental in helping me see this project through. Despite the many challenges that arose along the way, his support consistently lit a path forward.

I also owe deep gratitude to my second advisor, Professor Heather Guarnera. I would not have even begun this project without her. She has championed me in every academic aspect, and it was her belief in me that allowed me to believe that this project was possible in the first place. I will forever be grateful for her counsel and motivation. She has gone far beyond what would be considered exceptional for an advisor, and I am so fortunate to have had her in my corner.

Next, I would like to thank Dean Bowen for her unwavering support with any college-related matters that threatened to impede my progress outside the classroom. She has been a reliable source of information and encouragement throughout this process. I have yet to meet someone as efficient and responsive when it comes to answering emails and finding solutions.

Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude to the entire Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences. This has always been a department that truly cares about student learning and is willing to meet students where they are. It is through the hard work and dedication of my professors that I have been able to grow academically and, ultimately, complete this project.
